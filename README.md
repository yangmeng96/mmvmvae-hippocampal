# MMVM VAE: Hippocampal Neural Activities

This is the Hippocampal Neural Activities experiment part of the official code release for the NeurIPS 2024 paper [Unity by Diversity: Improved Representation Learning for Multimodal VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05300).

Comments and questions are always welcome. Just reach out to us!

## MMVM Prior
In this paper, we introduce the *MMVM VAE*, a novel multimodal VAE formulation using a shoft-sharing of information between modalities.

The proposed method is based on the MMVM prior $h(\mathbf{z} | \mathbf{X})$ that acts on the unimodal posterior approximations $q(\mathbf{z}_m | \mathbf{x}_m)$:

# Installation

To be able to run the experiments and reproduce the results shown in the paper, you need to install the ```mvvae``` conda environments using

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

# Data

The data can be downloaded through the link: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.7280/D14X30

# Benchmark Experiments

To run the experiment, you can use the following command from the root dir of the repository after having activated the conda environment

```
python main_rats_wsl.py model="mixedprior"
```

We use [WandB](https://wandb.ai/) and [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for logging and configuring our experiments.
So,

- make sure to have a WandB account
- you can easily set any experiment parameters either over the command line or using ```config.yaml``` files
